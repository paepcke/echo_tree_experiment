    <H1>Welcome to the EchoTree experiment</H1>

    The goal of this experiment/game is to determine which parameter
    settings are optimal for a new computer interface idea. The
    experiment tests nothing at all about you. The interface under
    test is to help people who interact with a motion and speech
    disabled individual. While the speech impaired person slowly types
    a sentence, one or more conversation partners can see on a Web
    page both the typing, and a graph that 'guesses' different
    conversational directions the typist might have in mind.
    <p>
    In this experiment you and one other person will interact via your
    computer, and the telephone. One of you will pretend that you
    cannot speak. The participant playing this 'disabled' role will
    see a sentence or two on their screen. They will start typing the
    sentence into a text field.
    <p>
    The other player, who will play the able bodied 'conversation
    partner' role, will try to guess over the phone what the impaired
    person is trying to say. When a guess is close, the disabled
    player may click on a button that says <i>That's Close; will type
    more.</i> The partner will see an indication of that button push
    on their end, and the disabled player will continue typing.
    <p>
    Hearing a good partial guess, the disabled player may decide to
    type information other than the precise sentence they were
    given. The goal is for the disabled person to have to type <b>as
    little as possible</b>. The exeriment system limits typing speed to
    what a motion impaired person might be able to manage. The
    computer will simply not accept faster typing. This effect will be
    obvious, and you do not need to remember to slow down.
    <p>
    When the disabled person decides that the partner has guessed the
    <b>essence</b> of the sentence, they press a button labeled <i>You
    got it!</i>  and a new sentence will be presented to the disabled
    person for another round. After 10 sentences, the players switch
    roles. The experiment finishes after that second round. Of course,
    either of you may stop and abort the experiment at any time if you
    need to.
    <p>
    It is crucial that the player in the 'disabled' role does not
    speak once they are presented with a sentence to type. Only the
    partner voices their guesses over the phone. It's a one-way
    conversation. We are testing how well this interaction would work
    if the disabled player really could not speak.
    <p>
    You will play with a player of your choice.  You will each type in
    your own email address below, plus your partner's email. For
    example, if you are John, and your email is john@google.com, and
    your game partner's email is doris@yahoo.com, you will type
    john@google.com as your email address, and doris@yahoo.com as your
    partner's address. Doris on the other hand, will type in
    doris@yahoo.com in the <i>Your email address</i> field, and
    john@google.com in the <i>Partner's email address field</i>. You
    will both press your <i>Next</i> button once you typed in the
    email addresses.
    <p>
    It is important that you use email addresses consistently: If John
    fills his partner's email in as doris@yahoo.com, then Doris needs
    to specify that very email as hers in the address field on her
    end. Otherwise the computer won't be able to tell that you are
    playing together, and nothing will work.
    <p>
    Your email will at most be used for me to contact you if something
    goes wrong, or to say thank you. The address will not be shared,
    sold, auctioned, or donated to the Mafia. The information's main
    purpose is for the computer to match you up with your player.
    <p>
    The computer will tell you when you are both logged in, and can
    begin. The first sentence will be a practice run. You can confer
    with each other over the phone during that practice run to ensure
    you are both clear.

    Please enter your email address and that of your partner, and then
    click the <i>Next</i> key:
    <div class="application" align="right">
      Your email address: <input class="twoLines" type="text" name="playerName1" id="playerName1"/><br>
      Partner's email address: <input class="twoLines" type="text" name="playerName2" id="playerName2"/>
    </div>
    <input type=button id=nextButton onclick=getAssignment() value="Next" />

    <script type=text/javascript>
      // Get player IDs for myself and the other player from browser cookie.
      // If that cookie is set, we'll fill in the email lines:

      var thisEmail   = getCookie("echoTreeOwnEmail");
      var otherEmail  = getCookie("echoTreeOtherEmail");

      if (typeof thisEmail !== "undefined")
        document.getElementById("playerName1").value = thisEmail;
      if (typeof otherEmail !== "undefined")
        document.getElementById("playerName2").value = otherEmail;
    </script>
